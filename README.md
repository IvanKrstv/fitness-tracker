Welcome to the repository for this fitness tracker app. 
It is a mini console app, built with Python, which handles a basic workout tracker. 
The information of the user is stored automatically in a file after closing the program so it can be
reused after reopening it.

The idea for the project was presented by the SoftUni lecturer
[Mario Zahariev](https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof).

I am open to looking at pull requests and any improvements at all because I don't find the project finished
and have plenty ideas to continue developing it.

😊 I would also be glad if someone is open to working on utilizing the app and creating a simple responsive
front-end with me, as I am still not really familiar with the front-end concepts. 😊
